---

## 7. Enrollment Distribution Analysis

### Students Per Course (2025-26 Estimates)

**24-Seat Capacity Model:**
- Total students: 124 (Fall 2025)
- Scheduled course sections: 16 (Fall 2025)
- Average students per section: **7.75 students**

**Reality Check:**
This average is misleadingly low because:
1. Students take multiple courses
2. Some courses have high demand (DESN 216: 52 avg)
3. Some courses have low enrollment (DESN 336: 8 avg)

### Actual Enrollment Distribution (Fall 2025)

Based on historical enrollment data:

**High Demand (30+ students, exceeds 24-seat capacity):**
- DESN 216 (Digital Foundations): 52 avg = **2.2x capacity**
- DESN 100 (Drawing Communication): 35 avg = **1.5x capacity**

**Medium Demand (15-29 students, fits 24-seat):**

## 9. Capacity Planning for Growth

### Current Capacity

**Faculty Capacity:**
- Full-time equivalent (FTE): ~8.5 faculty
- Average sections per FTE: 5.5
- **Total section capacity:** ~47 sections/year

**Room Capacity:**
- Active rooms: 5 (206, 209, 210, CEB 102, CEB 104)
- Unused rooms: 2 (207, 212)
- Time slots: 6 per week (MW 10, 1, 4 + TR 10, 1, 4)
- **Total room capacity:** 7 rooms × 6 slots = 42 room-slots/quarter

**Current Utilization:**
- Fall 2025: 16 sections = 38% of room capacity
- **Plenty of room capacity available**

### Enrollment Thresholds

**Phase 1: Current State (124 students)**
- Status: Manageable with existing faculty/rooms
- Faculty workload: High but sustainable
- Action: Monitor and optimize

**Phase 2: 130-140 Students (Projected 2026-28)**
- Status: Faculty approaching limits
- Ariel Sopu, Sonaj Durr, Mindy Lybbert at capacity
- Action: Hire 1 additional lecturer

**Phase 3: 140-150 Students (Projected 2028-30)**
- Status: Requires additional faculty
- Multiple courses need extra sections
- Action: Hire 1 full-time faculty + 2 adjuncts

**Phase 4: 150+ Students (Beyond 2030)**
- Status: Program restructuring needed
- Consider cohort limits or admission caps
- Action: Strategic plan for program size

---

## 10. Comparison to Course Offerings

### Fall 2024 (Peak Enrollment: 128 students)

**Course Sections Offered:** 16
**Students per Section (if evenly distributed):** 8.0

**Reality: Uneven Distribution**
- High-demand courses (DESN 216, 100): 52, 35 students
- Medium courses (DESN 338, 200, etc.): 15-25 students
- Low-enrollment (DESN 326, 336): 8-10 students

**Inference:**
- Not all students take the same course load
- Enrollment concentrated in foundation/required courses
- Electives have variable demand

### Estimated Student Course Load

**Assumptions:**
- Average student: 3 courses per quarter (15 credits)
- 128 students × 3 courses = **384 course enrollments**
- 16 course sections offered
- **Average enrollment per section:** 384 ÷ 16 = **24 students**

**This aligns perfectly with 24-seat capacity!**

**However:**
- High-demand courses pull 2x capacity (need splits)
- Low-demand courses pull 0.5x capacity (under-utilized)
- Need flexible scheduling and section additions

### Foundation Courses (100-200 level)
- **DESN 100, 200, 216**
- **Estimated enrollment:** ~60-70% of all students
- **Calculation:** 124 students × 70% = ~87 students in foundation courses

### Core Design (300-level)
- **DESN 243, 263, 301, 326, 335, 338, 359, etc.**
- **Estimated enrollment:** ~50-60% of students
- **Calculation:** 124 students × 55% = ~68 students in 300-level

### Advanced (400-level)
- **DESN 401, 458, 463, 468, 480, 490**
- **Estimated enrollment:** ~30-40% of students (juniors/seniors)
- **Calculation:** 124 students × 35% = ~43 students in 400-level

**Note:** Percentages overlap because students take courses at multiple levels
