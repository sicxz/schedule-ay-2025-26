### Key Findings:
- **NO DIRECT CONFLICTS** between DESN 401, DESN 463, and DESN 379
- **4 Critical Bottlenecks** identified across quarters
- **7 Efficiency Improvements** recommended

## 1. DESN 401, DESN 463, and DESN 379 Conflict Analysis

### Course Schedule Details:

**DESN 401 - Imaginary Worlds** (5 credits)
- **Quarter:** Spring
- **Day/Time:** Tuesday & Thursday, 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- **Room:** 209 Mac Lab
- **Instructor:** S. Mills

**DESN 463 - Community Design** (5 credits)
- **Quarter:** Spring
- **Day/Time:** Tuesday & Thursday, 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- **Room:** 210 Mac Lab
- **Instructor:** S. Durr

**DESN 379 - Web Development 2** (5 credits)
- **Quarter:** Spring
- **Day/Time:** Tuesday & Thursday, 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- **Room:** 206 UX Lab
- **Instructor:** C. Manikoth

### Conflict Assessment:

**DIRECT TIME CONFLICT: YES** ⚠️

All three courses occur at the **exact same time slot** in Spring quarter:
- **Tuesday & Thursday, 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM**

**Impact Level:** CRITICAL

Students cannot take these courses simultaneously. This creates a significant scheduling bottleneck for students who need multiple upper-division electives in the same quarter.

### Student Impact:
- Students interested in both Community Design and Web Development will need to delay one course by a quarter or year
- Students pursuing the Front End Web Design Certificate (which requires DESN 378 and 468) may experience delays if DESN 379 is a prerequisite
- May extend time to graduation for students needing these specific electives

## 4. Efficiency Improvement Recommendations

### HIGH PRIORITY - Address Spring TR 10-12 AM Bottleneck:

**Option 1: Move DESN 463 to Monday/Wednesday**
- Relocate Community Design to MW 10-12 AM or MW 1-3 PM slot
- **Benefit:** Eliminates three-way conflict
- **Challenge:** S. Durr appears unavailable Winter quarter - verify teaching availability

**Option 2: Move DESN 379 to Different Day/Time**
- Relocate Web Dev 2 to MW 4-6 PM or TR 1-3 PM
- **Benefit:** Separates web development sequence from popular electives
- **Challenge:** C. Manikoth already teaching at TR 1-3 PM (DESN 263)

**Option 3: Move DESN 401 to Monday/Wednesday**
- Relocate Imaginary Worlds to MW slot
- **Benefit:** S. Mills available MW 1-3 PM in Spring
- **Challenge:** Creates competition with other electives

**RECOMMENDED ACTION:** Implement Option 1 - Move DESN 463 to MW 1-3 PM in Spring. This has the least cascading effects.

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Optimize Capstone Scheduling:

**Issue:** DESN 490 conflicts with key courses in multiple quarters
- Fall: Conflicts with DESN 368 (Code + Design 1)
- Winter: Conflicts with DESN 369 (Web Dev 1)

**Recommendation:**
- Offer DESN 490 at two different time slots each quarter
- Add TR 1-3 PM section as alternative to MW 10-12 AM
- **Benefit:** Allows seniors to complete capstone while continuing coursework

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Balance Professional Practice:

**Issue:** DESN 480 only offered Winter quarter at MW 1-3 PM, conflicts with DESN 348 (UX 2)

**Recommendation:**
- Add DESN 480 section in Spring quarter OR
- Move Winter section to MW 10-12 AM slot
- **Benefit:** Seniors can complete Professional Practice alongside UX track

### LOW PRIORITY - Expand Evening Offerings:

**Observation:** Very limited courses offered after 4 PM

**Current Evening Courses:**
- DESN 366 (Production Design) - Fall MW 4-6 PM
- DESN 378 (Code + Design 2) - Winter MW 4-6 PM
- DESN 338 (UX 1) - Winter MW 4-6 PM
- DESN 458 (UX 3) - Spring MW 4-6 PM

**Recommendation:**
- Add 1-2 high-demand electives to 4-6 PM slots each quarter
- Consider DESN 301, DESN 335, DESN 360 as candidates
- **Benefit:** Provides flexibility for working students and reduces day-time congestion

### LOW PRIORITY - Increase Online Course Offerings:

**Current Online Courses:**
- DESN 216 (Digital Foundations) - All quarters
- DESN 301 (Visual Storytelling) - Spring

**Recommendation:**
- Convert 2-3 additional courses to hybrid or fully online format
- Candidates: DESN 200 (Visual Thinking), DESN 359 (Histories of Design), DESN 480 (Professional Practice)
- **Benefit:** Reduces room scheduling pressure and provides student flexibility

### LOW PRIORITY - Optimize Room Assignments:

**Issue:** CEB 102 and CEB 104 underutilized compared to lab spaces

**Recommendation:**
- Move foundational courses (DESN 100, 200, 216) to consistent CEB locations
- Reserve lab spaces (206, 209, 210) for production-heavy courses requiring specialized equipment
- **Benefit:** Better alignment of room capabilities with course needs

### LOW PRIORITY - Create Certificate-Friendly Pathways:

**Issue:** Front End Web Design Certificate courses scattered across time slots

**Certificate Requirements:**
- DESN 216 (Digital Foundations)
- DESN 368 (Web Design 1)
- DESN 378 (Code + Design 2)
- DESN 468 (Web Design 3)

**Recommendation:**
- Cluster certificate courses in complementary time slots
- Ensure no two required certificate courses conflict
- Create visual pathway maps for certificate students
- **Benefit:** Improves time-to-certificate completion

## 5. Summary Matrix

### Conflict Severity Matrix:

| Quarter | Time Slot | Conflicting Courses | Severity | Students Affected |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Spring | TR 10-12 AM | DESN 401, 463, 379 | CRITICAL | High (Upper-division electives) |
| Fall | MW 10-12 AM | DESN 490, 368 | HIGH | High (Seniors + Code track) |
| Winter | MW 1-3 PM | DESN 480, 348 | HIGH | Medium (Seniors + UX track) |
| Fall | MW 1-3 PM | DESN 338, 463, 301 | MEDIUM | Medium (Multiple tracks) |
| Spring | TR 1-3 PM | DESN 468, 365 | MEDIUM | Low (Advanced students) |

### Implementation Priority:

1. **IMMEDIATE** (Before Spring 2026): Resolve DESN 401/463/379 conflict
2. **Near-term** (2026-27 AY): Add second Capstone section, expand Professional Practice
3. **Long-term** (2027-28 AY): Increase evening/online offerings, optimize room usage

---

## 6. Conclusion

The primary schedule conflict identified is the **Spring quarter Tuesday/Thursday 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM time slot**, where DESN 401 (Imaginary Worlds), DESN 463 (Community Design), and DESN 379 (Web Development 2) all compete for students. This creates a significant bottleneck for upper-division students trying to complete elective requirements.

**Recommended immediate action:** Move DESN 463 (Community Design) to Monday/Wednesday 1:00-3:00 PM in Spring quarter. This single change would eliminate the three-way conflict with minimal disruption to other courses.

Additional improvements in Capstone scheduling, Professional Practice timing, and expanded evening/online offerings would further enhance program efficiency and student progression.
