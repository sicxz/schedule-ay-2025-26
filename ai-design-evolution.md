## 11. Comparative Analysis: Other Experimental Courses

### DESN 396 (Japan Study Abroad) - Recurring Experimental

**Comparison:**
- Also uses DESN 396 course code
- Winter 2026 offering (M.Lybbert)
- Different model: **Remains experimental**, doesn't transition to permanent

**Why Different Trajectory?**
- One-time per year offering (not scalable)
- Dependent on international partnerships
- Small enrollment (~15 students max)
- Logistical constraints (travel, cost)

**Lesson:** Not all experimental courses become permanent. Study Abroad model works as recurring experimental.

### DESN 496 - Not Offered (2025-26)

**Status:** Experimental course code not used in current schedule

**Interpretation:**
- Department has limited experimental offerings
- Focus on stabilizing existing curriculum
- DESN 374 absorbed the "innovation" slot

---

## 12. Recommendations for Future Course Development

### Model for Other Emerging Topics

**If developing new experimental courses (e.g., VR/AR Design, Sustainable Design):**

1. **Year 1:** Offer as DESN 396 or 496 (experimental)
   - Pilot with 10-15 students
   - Gather enrollment and feedback data
   - Refine learning objectives

2. **Year 2:** Transition to DESN 3XX (transitional number)
   - Stabilize curriculum
   - Develop assessments
   - Prove sustained demand (2-3 quarters)

3. **Year 3:** Apply for permanent course number
   - Submit to curriculum committee
   - Provide enrollment data, student evaluations
   - Demonstrate industry relevance

4. **Year 4+:** Integrate into regular schedule
   - Assign permanent course code
   - Include in catalog and degree requirements
   - Plan for faculty coverage (Travis model vs. rotation)

### Best Practices from DESN 374

**Replicate:**
- Faculty champion with expertise
- Pilot-test-refine process
- Industry demand validation
- Flexible curriculum design

**Avoid:**
- Rushing to permanence without data
- Technology-specific course titles (tools change)
- Siloing content (integrate across curriculum)
- Ignoring ethical/critical thinking components
