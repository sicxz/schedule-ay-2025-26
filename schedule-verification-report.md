## 4. Discrepancies Found

### DESN 263 Spring Quarter Placement

**Discrepancy Details:**
- **Course:** DESN 263 (Visual Communication Design 1)
- **Instructor:** A.Sopu
- **Credits:** 5

**Current scheduleData shows:**
- Day: Monday & Wednesday
- Time: 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM
- Room: 210 Mac Lab

**Schedule image shows:**
- Day: Monday & Wednesday
- Time: 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM
- Room: 210 Mac Lab

**Resolution Required:** Update scheduleData to reflect 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM time slot

**Impact Analysis:**
- Low impact - only affects Spring quarter
- No room conflict (same room, different time)
- Does not affect enrollment calculations
- May affect student schedule planning if relying on scheduleData

---

## 5. Special Notations

### DESN 359 Spring Quarter - "(4G3?)" Notation

The Spring schedule image shows DESN 359 (Histories of Design) with the notation "(4G3?)" after the course listing.

**Inference:** This likely indicates:
- 400-level General Education requirement
- Course may count toward Gen Ed Category 3
- Question mark suggests pending confirmation

**Recommendation:** Confirm with registrar if DESN 359 satisfies a specific Gen Ed requirement.

---

## 6. Room Utilization Analysis

### Rooms Used Across All Quarters:
1. **206 UX Lab** - Heavily utilized (15 course sections across 3 quarters)
2. **209 Mac Lab** - Heavily utilized (18 course sections across 3 quarters)
3. **210 Mac Lab** - Heavily utilized (15 course sections across 3 quarters)
4. **CEB 102** - Moderately utilized (9 course sections across 3 quarters)
5. **CEB 104** - Moderately utilized (9 course sections across 3 quarters)

### Rooms NOT Used:
1. **207 Media Lab** - Zero utilization
2. **212 Project Lab** - Zero utilization

**Inference:** Rooms 207 and 212 are either:
- Reserved for other departments
- Underutilized due to equipment limitations
- Available for schedule expansion
- Not suitable for current course offerings

**Recommendation:** Investigate whether these rooms can be utilized for:
- Additional course sections (DESN 216, DESN 100 - high demand)
- Evening courses to reduce daytime conflicts
- Specialized equipment-based courses

---

## 7. Peak Conflict Times

### Highest Conflict Slots:

**1. Tuesday/Thursday 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM**
- Fall: 4 simultaneous courses

- **Conflict Level:** CRITICAL

**3. Monday/Wednesday 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM**
- Fall: 4 simultaneous courses
- Winter: 3 simultaneous courses
- Spring: 4 simultaneous courses

### Recommendations:
1. Consider moving some TR 1:00 PM courses to unused rooms (207, 212)
2. Expand into 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM slots to distribute load
3. Offer high-demand courses (DESN 216, DESN 100) in multiple time slots
4. Utilize Friday or evening slots for electives

---

## 10. Missing/Not Offered Courses

### Courses NOT in 2025-26 Schedule:

**Case-by-Case (Expected):**
- DESN 399 (Special Topics)
- DESN 491 (Senior Project)
- DESN 495 (Internship)
- DESN 499 (Independent Study)

**Experimental/Deprecated:**
- DESN 325 (Emergent Design) - Replaced by DESN 374
- DESN 496 (Experimental Topics) - Not offered in 2025-26

**Inference:**
- DESN 325 was a transitional course between experimental DESN 396 and institutionalized DESN 374
- DESN 374 (AI + Design) is now a permanent offering, taught by Travis Masingale every quarter

---

## 11. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ **Fix DESN 263 Spring discrepancy** - Update scheduleData to 4:00 PM slot
2. 🔍 **Confirm TBD instructors** for Winter/Spring Capstone (DESN 490)
3. 📝 **Clarify DESN 359 (4G3?)** notation with registrar
4. 📊 **Investigate Meg's status** (mentioned as Lecturer but not in schedule)

### Strategic Considerations:
1. **Room utilization:** Activate rooms 207 and 212 to reduce conflicts
2. **Faculty load:** Monitor Colin Manikoth's 9-course load (may be unsustainable)
3. **Conflict reduction:** Redistribute TR 10:00 AM and TR 1:00 PM courses
4. **Evening expansion:** Consider 6:00-8:00 PM slots for working students
5. **Friday offerings:** Explore Friday classes to spread weekly load
6. **High-demand courses:** Add sections for DESN 216, DESN 100 (enrollment data shows need)

### Documentation Updates:
1. Update `schedule-data-reference.md` with DESN 263 correction
2. Create `course-categorizations.md` for case-by-case/experimental tracking
3. Create `faculty-classifications.md` with rank and load analysis
4. Create `enrollment-trends-quarterly.md` for historical analysis
5. Create `ai-design-evolution.md` documenting DESN 396→325→374 transition
