## ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. Faculty Workload Calculator (`scripts/workload-calculator.js`)

**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested

**Features Implemented:**
- Special credit calculations:
  - DESN 499: 1 credit = 0.2 workload credit
  - DESN 495: 1 credit = 0.1 workload credit
  - All other courses: 1 credit = 1.0 workload credit
- Faculty capacity utilization (60% underutilized, 60-100% optimal, >100% overloaded)
- Annual applied learning totals (DESN 499 + DESN 495)
- Trend analysis across 4 academic years (2022-23 to 2025-26)
- JSON export for dashboard consumption

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/workload-calculator.js enrollment-data/processed
```

**Output:** `workload-data.json`

**Key Findings:**
- **7 faculty members significantly overloaded** (>150% utilization):
  - Durr Sonja: 212.4% (138 credits, 95.6 workload)

## 📋 NOT STARTED (Tier 1)

### 4. Enhanced Forecasting with Seasonal Adjustments

**Status:** ⏳ Not started

**Requirements:**
- Add seasonal indices (Fall: 1.15x, Winter: 0.95x, Spring: 1.05x)
- Improve confidence intervals beyond current linear regression
- Create 3-scenario forecasts (conservative/moderate/optimistic)
- Add forecast accuracy metrics

**Files to Create:**
- `/scripts/advanced-forecasting.js`
- Update `/scripts/process-enrollment-data.js` to use seasonal model

**Priority:** Medium (improves prediction accuracy)

## 🔗 INTEGRATION TASKS

### Link Workload Dashboard from Main Pages

**Status:** ⏳ Not started

**Tasks:**
1. Add "Faculty Workload" link to index.html navigation
2. Add "Faculty Workload" link to enrollment-dashboard.html
3. Create bidirectional navigation between all dashboard pages
4. Add icon/button in header for quick access

**Example:**
```html
<a href="pages/workload-dashboard.html" class="nav-link">
    👥 Faculty Workload
</a>
```

---

### Update Data Processing Agent

**Status:** ⏳ Not started

**Goal:** Integrate workload calculations into `process-enrollment-data.js`

**Tasks:**
1. Import WorkloadCalculator class
2. Generate workload data alongside enrollment data
3. Combine into unified `analytics-data.json`
4. Eliminate need for separate workload-calculator.js run

**Benefits:**
- Single command to generate all analytics
- Synchronized data updates
- Reduced manual steps

## 📈 KEY METRICS & INSIGHTS

### Workload Analysis Results:
- **Average Faculty Workload:** 35.2 credits per year
- **Overload Rate:** 15.6% of faculty (7 of 45)
- **Underutilization Rate:** 62.2% (28 of 45) - many adjuncts/visiting faculty
- **Applied Learning Growth:** +47% from 2023-24 to 2024-25

### Applied Learning Breakdown:
- **DESN 499 (Independent Study):**
  - 2024-25: 110 students, 110 credits → 22.0 workload credits
  - Most supervised by: Durr Sonja, Breen Melinda, Masingale Travis

- **DESN 495 (Internship):**
  - 2024-25: 82 students, 71 credits → 7.1 workload credits
  - Critical for student practical experience

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate:** Address faculty overload (7 faculty >150%)
2. **Short-term:** Hire 1-2 adjuncts to balance workload
3. **Long-term:** Formalize applied learning supervision limits

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

1. **Applied Learning Credits Missing:** Some CSV records have missing Credits field, showing 0 even when students are enrolled
   - **Impact:** Applied learning trends may undercount 2022-23 and 2025-26
   - **Fix:** Add Credits field to all CSV records or infer from course code

2. **Faculty Name Variations:** Same faculty listed multiple ways (e.g., "Sopu Ariel" vs "Sopu_Ariel" vs "Sopu. Ariel")
   - **Impact:** Workload split across multiple entries
   - **Fix:** Normalize faculty names in CSV processing

3. **Rank Information Missing:** Faculty ranks not in enrollment data
   - **Impact:** Using default "Lecturer" rank (45 credit max) for all
   - **Fix:** Create `faculty-ranks.json` mapping file

## 💡 SUGGESTIONS FOR USER

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Review workload data:** Open `workload-dashboard.html` to see faculty overload issues
2. **Export CSV:** Use export button to share with department chair
3. **Validate data:** Check if faculty name variations need normalization

### Data Quality Improvements:
1. Add Credits field to all enrollment records
2. Create faculty rank mapping file for accurate utilization calculations
3. Standardize faculty name format across all CSV files

### Next Features to Prioritize:
1. **Academic year selector** - Essential for historical analysis
2. **Enhanced forecasting** - Improves hiring/planning decisions
3. **Adjunct predictor** - Answers "how many adjuncts do we need next year?"
