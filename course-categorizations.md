**Total Regular Courses:** 31 unique courses

---

## 2. Case-by-Case Courses

These courses are arranged individually with faculty and do not appear in the regular quarterly schedule. Enrollment is handled through special permissions.

### Independent Study & Research

| Course | Name | Enrollment Type | Credits | Faculty Oversight |
|--------|------|----------------|---------|-------------------|
| DESN 399 | Special Topics | Variable | 1-5 | Department Chair approval |
| DESN 491 | Senior Project | Individual | 1-5 | Faculty advisor required |
| DESN 495 | Internship | Individual | 1-15 | Requires internship coordinator approval |
| DESN 499 | Independent Study | Individual | 1-5 | Faculty sponsor required |

### Transition Course: DESN 490 Capstone

**Historical Status:**
- **Pre-2025:** Case-by-case arrangement with faculty
- **2025-26:** Regularly scheduled every quarter

**Current Schedule:**
- Fall 2025: C.Manikoth (210 Mac Lab, MW 10-12)
- Winter 2026: TBD (209 Mac Lab, TR 10-12)
- Spring 2026: TBD (210 Mac Lab, MW 10-12)

**Inference:** Department is institutionalizing Capstone to ensure all seniors complete this requirement in a structured cohort environment rather than independently.

**Enrollment Trend:**
- Average: 14 students
- Peak: 25 students (Spring 2025)
- Trend: Growing as it becomes required

---

## 3. Experimental Courses

These courses are pilot programs or special offerings that may not continue beyond their initial offering. They use special course codes (296, 396, 496) and require department approval.

### Currently Offered (2025-26)

| Course | Name | Offering | Credits | Instructor | Status |
|--------|------|----------|---------|------------|--------|
| DESN 396 | Japan Study Abroad | Winter 2026 (ARRANGED) | 5 | M.Lybbert | Recurring experimental |

### Deprecated/Transitioned Courses

| Course | Name | Last Offered | Status | Replaced By |
|--------|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| DESN 296 | (Unknown) | Unknown | Not in recent records | N/A |
| DESN 325 | Emergent Design | ~Winter 2024 - Spring 2025 | **DEPRECATED** | DESN 374 |
| DESN 496 | Experimental Topics | Unknown | Not offered in 2025-26 | N/A |

## 6. Course Sequences & Prerequisites

### Animation Minor Sequence
1. **DESN 326** (Introduction to Animation) - Fall
2. **DESN 355** (Motion Design) - Winter
3. **DESN 365** (Motion Design 2) - Spring
4. **DESN 336** (3D Animation) - Winter (can be taken concurrently with 355)

**Pattern:** Students must start in Fall to complete full sequence in one academic year.

### Code + Design Sequence
1. **DESN 368** (Code + Design 1) - Fall
2. **DESN 378** (Code + Design 2) - Winter
3. **DESN 468** (Code + Design 3) - Spring

**Pattern:** Linear progression through academic year, requires Fall start.

### UX Design Sequence

2. **DESN 348** (UX Design 2) - Winter
3. **DESN 458** (UX Design 3) - Spring

**Pattern:** Flexible entry (can start any quarter), but 2-3 requires Winter/Spring progression.

### Web Development Sequence
1. **DESN 369** (Web Development 1) - Winter
2. **DESN 379** (Web Development 2) - Spring

**Pattern:** Must start in Winter, complete in Spring.

## 7. Inferences & Observations

### Scheduling Philosophy

**1. Sequential Courses Follow Academic Year**
- Code+Design (Fall → Winter → Spring)
- Animation (Fall → Winter → Spring)
- UX Design (flexible entry, but 2→3 is Winter→Spring)

**Inference:** Department designs sequences to align with Fall entry for new students, allowing completion within one academic year.

**2. Foundation Courses Offered Every Quarter**
- DESN 100, 200, 216 available every quarter
- Allows students to enter program at any point
- Provides flexibility for students who need to retake courses

**3. Specialized/Adjunct Courses in Spring**
- DESN 350 (Photography), DESN 384 (Sound), DESN 305 (Social Media)
- Spring only, taught by adjuncts

**Inference:** Spring quarter has more elective/specialized content, possibly due to:
- Faculty availability (adjuncts more available in Spring)
- Student schedules (seniors graduating, want specialized electives)
- Budget allocation (adjunct funds allocated to Spring)

**4. Capstone Every Quarter (NEW)**
- Allows students to graduate any quarter
- Reduces bottleneck of Spring-only capstone
- Distributes faculty advising load

**Inference:** Department responding to student demand for flexible graduation timelines.

### Course Viability Concerns

**Low Enrollment Courses (< 10 students):**
- DESN 336 (3D Animation) - 8 avg
- DESN 326 (Introduction to Animation) - 9 avg
- DESN 350 (Digital Photography) - 10 avg
- DESN 365 (Motion Design 2) - 10 avg

**Recommendation:** Monitor these courses for continuation. May need:
- Marketing to increase enrollment
- Combination with other courses
- Alternate year offerings
- Online format to attract wider audience

**High Enrollment Courses (> 30 students):**
- DESN 216 (Digital Foundations) - 52 avg
- DESN 100 (Drawing Communication) - 35 avg

**Recommendation:** These courses need:
- Multiple sections (already implemented)
- Larger room assignments
- Additional faculty/adjunct support

---

## 8. Recommendations

### For Regular Courses:
1. **Continue every-quarter offerings** for DESN 100, 200, 216, 243, 263, 338, 359, 374
2. **Monitor low-enrollment courses** (336, 326, 350, 365) for viability
3. **Consider expanding popular courses** (374, 338, 369) to multiple quarters
4. **Evaluate adjunct-taught courses** for potential full-time faculty integration

### For Case-by-Case Courses:
1. **Formalize procedures** for DESN 491, 495, 499, 399
2. **Create oversight structure** for independent study courses
3. **Track completion rates** for internships and senior projects
4. **Consider maximum enrollments** to maintain quality

### For Experimental Courses:
1. **Document DESN 374 transition success** as model for future courses
2. **Evaluate DESN 396 (Study Abroad)** for permanent status
3. **Create pathway** for experimental → transitional → permanent course numbers
4. **Allocate experimental slots** for faculty innovation (2-3 per year)

### For Sequence Courses:
1. **Ensure prerequisite enforcement** for sequential courses
2. **Monitor enrollment flow** through sequences (attrition analysis)
3. **Consider adding summer offerings** to accelerate completion
4. **Communicate sequence requirements** clearly to advisors and students

## 9. Future Considerations

### Potential New Regular Courses
Based on industry trends and student demand, consider developing:
- **DESN 3XX** (Extended Reality/VR Design)
- **DESN 3XX** (Sustainable Design)
- **DESN 4XX** (Design Research Methods)
- **DESN 4XX** (Design Systems)

### Potential Experimental Offerings
Test demand with experimental codes:
- **DESN 396** (Accessibility Design)
- **DESN 396** (Speculative Design)
- **DESN 396** (Design for Social Impact)

### Sequence Expansion
Consider creating new minor sequences:
- **Data Visualization Minor** (4 courses)
- **Brand Design Minor** (4 courses)
- **AR/VR Design Minor** (4 courses)
