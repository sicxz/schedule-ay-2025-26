# DESN-325: Emergent Design

## Catalog Description

This course explores the benefits and risks of new design technologies. Students learn to recognize emergent design technologies and use them to address design problems and explore ways in which new tools reference past paradigms in order to create forward-thinking design solutions. Through hands-on, project-based learning, students investigate the possibilities inherent in new technologies such as AI, AR/VR/ and Computational Design. This course may be repeated.
