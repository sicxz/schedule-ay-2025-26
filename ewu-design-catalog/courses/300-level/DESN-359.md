# DESN-359: Histories of Design

## Catalog Description

Focuses on multiple stories and multiple histories within design practice. Emphasis is placed on the context (social/cultural/political/technological) within which themes emerged and designs were created. Student-led research/discussion is focused on expanding the story of design by discovering and sharing those who have been largely left out of the design history books (female/femme, Black, Native American, Latinx, Asian, African, Australian, indigenous peoples, and more).
