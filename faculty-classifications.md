## 7. Workload Analysis & Concerns

### Overloaded Faculty

**1. Ariel Sopu (Lecturer)**
- **9 sections, 315 students**
- Teaching all three quarters with no breaks
- Foundation courses require extensive grading
- **Concern:** Burnout risk, need for additional support

**2. Mindy Lybbert (Full Professor)**
- **8 sections, 143 students + study abroad coordination**
- Winter quarter has 4 courses + international program
- **Concern:** Unsustainable Winter load, may need course release

**3. Sonaj Durr (Senior Lecturer)**
- **8 sections, 132 students**
- Teaching all three quarters
- Multiple preparations (3 different courses)
- **Concern:** Need for adjunct support or course reduction

**4. Colin Manikoth (Assistant Professor)**
- **7 sections, 125 students**
- Pre-tenure year with 6 different course preparations
- **Concern:** Research/publication expectations may be compromised

### Underutilized Faculty

**1. Ginelle Hustrulid (Full Professor)**
- **3 sections, 31 students**
- Low average enrollment (10.3 students/section)
- **Inference:** Likely has significant administrative/committee role
- **Question:** Is animation specialization sustainable with low enrollment?

### Adjunct Dependency

**Total Adjunct Sections:** 11 (18.6% of all sections)
**Total Adjunct Students:** 302 (23.6% of all students)

**Courses Dependent on Adjuncts:**
- DESN 100 (Drawing) - 2 sections via S.Allison
- DESN 216 (Online) - 3 sections via Barton/Pettigrew
- DESN 305 - E.Norris
- DESN 336 - Unnamed adjunct
- DESN 350 - Unnamed adjunct
- DESN 384 - J.Braukmann
- DESN 490 (Winter/Spring) - TBD

**Concern:** Heavy reliance on adjuncts for:
- High-demand foundation courses (DESN 100, 216)
- Capstone (critical graduation requirement)
- Specialized electives

**Risk:** Adjunct availability can be unpredictable, affecting schedule stability

## 10. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Confirm TBD Instructors**
   - Assign Winter/Spring Capstone instructors ASAP
   - Critical for senior graduation planning

2. **Verify Meg's Status**
   - Update faculty roster
   - Redistribute courses if no longer teaching

3. **Review Colin Manikoth's Load**
   - Pre-tenure faculty with 7 courses may need relief
   - Consider course release for research/tenure prep

4. **Support Ariel Sopu**
   - 9 sections with 315 students is unsustainable
   - Consider hiring additional lecturer or adjunct for DESN 100/216

### Strategic Recommendations

5. **Redistribute Mindy Lybbert's Winter Load**
   - 4 courses + study abroad coordination is excessive
   - Consider moving one course to different quarter

6. **Evaluate Animation Program**
   - Ginelle Hustrulid teaching 3 low-enrollment courses (avg 10.3)
   - Assess viability or consider combined sections

7. **Reduce Adjunct Dependency**
   - 18.6% of sections taught by adjuncts
   - Consider full-time hire for specialized areas (sound, photography)

8. **Balance Course Levels**
   - Only 5 sections of 100-level (8.5% of total)
   - May need more foundation capacity given enrollment growth

### Long-Term Planning

9. **Faculty Hiring Priorities**
   - **Priority 1:** Lecturer for foundation courses (support Ariel Sopu)
   - **Priority 2:** Specialized faculty (animation, sound, photography)
   - **Priority 3:** Web development (support Colin Manikoth)

10. **Succession Planning**
    - Colin Manikoth promoted to Associate = salary increase
    - Plan for retirements (full professors)
    - Develop adjunct pool for critical courses
